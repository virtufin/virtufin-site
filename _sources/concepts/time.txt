Time Point
----------

Points in time are represented by classes implementing
the trait :api:`TimePoint <virtufin.util.TimePoint>`.

Depending on the required granularity, there are different implementation
of :api:`TimePoint <virtufin/util/TimePoint>`, such as

* :api:`Day <virtufin.util.Day>`, where the granularity is a day
* :api:`Date <virtufin.util.Date>`, a wrapper around :javaapi:`java.util.Date <java/util/Date>`, which has a granularity of milliseconds
